# What's for Dinner? 
An application for food indecision.

### Abstract:
Have you ever had trouble deciding what to cook and eat? 

&ensp;  This application allows the user to choose a meal type, and through selection, get food suggestions. There are four radio button the user can choose from: side, main dish, dessert, or entire meal. Based on the user selection, a random food from that category type will be displayed after the user presses the "Let's cook!" button. When the user selects the entire meal button, a random main dish, side and dessert will be suggested. 

&ensp; After a suggestion has been made, the user can choose to clear the display box. If the user does not select a radio button and selects 'Let's cook!' the user will be asked to please select a choice.

### Context:
The completion of this project marks the end of week 3 for Mod 1, halfway through the first Module at Turing. I worked on this project for approximatly 15 hours, spanning five days.

### Learning Goals:
&ensp; The learning goals for this project were to gain experience writing and utilizing HTML and CSS to match a provided comp, as well as to buid an application. 

&ensp; We were also practicing how to creating functionality through javascript, targeting and creating function for our newly created and individualized HTML and CSs

### Wins + Challenges:
&ensp; A win I had during this project was completing the html, css and functionality through iteration 1 a lot quicker than I had anticipated. I am also proud of my organization in all of the docs and the ability to read through the code.

&ensp; Despite this being a solo project, I also am proud that once I had a plan, I was able to execute the next tasks in a calm manner.

&ensp; A challenge I faced was breaking down the functionality of iteration 1 into manageable step. It took the support of peers, giving me guiding questions of what I needed certain actions to accomplish, in order to get the ideas for each function. 

&ensp; I would like to continue to work on my independent problem solving skills, as well as having competence in my abilities when I work alone.
