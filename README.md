# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

# What's for Dinner? 
An application for food indecision.

### Abstract:
Have you ever had trouble deciding what to cook and eat? 

&ensp;  This application allows the user to choose a meal type, and through selection, get food suggestions. There are four radio button the user can choose from: side, main dish, dessert, or entire meal. Based on the user selection, a random food from that category type will be displayed after the user presses the "Let's cook!" button. When the user selects the entire meal button, a random main dish, side and dessert will be suggested. 

&ensp; After a suggestion has been made, the user can choose to clear the display box. If the user does not select a radio button and selects 'Let's cook!' the user will be asked to please select a choice.

### Learning Goals:
&ensp; The learning goals for this project were to gain experience writing and utilizing HTML and CSS to match a provided comp, as well as to buid an application. 

&ensp; We were also practicing how to creating functionality through javascript, targeting and creating function for our newly created and individualized HTML and CSs
